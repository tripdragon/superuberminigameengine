game()
^ bind game is starting
maintains a in context catch all object
w = {}
which gets unique object references
["a","b"].join(" ")
w["a b"] = instantance thingy


load taco car model "dkfjngkdjfgjfg"
(load __ __ model url)

var aa = 'load taco car model "dkfjngkdjfgjfg"';
var bb = aa.split(" ");
// (load __ __ model url)

var a1 = bb.indexOf("load")
var a2 = bb.indexOf("model")
var a3 = bb[bb.length-1];
cc = bb.slice(a1+1,a2)

// if index 0 and 1 have an inbetween, and a string at length-1
// or unknown words form a var then load+model have a string at length-1
// run
var t = loadModel(url){}
t.onload = ?¿

if(a1 is 0)

// cc here could BE the var
// cc === gg["taco", "car"] false!! this is good
// ["taco", "car"] = function(x){console.log(x)} fail, darn it
// "a" = function(){} also fail
// but 
w = {}
w["fishsticks"] = 4
will work!!
hmmmm
as will w["narf fish"] = 4

["a","b"].join(" ")

so second taco car
etc, since each is unique on {}


if(cc !== ""){
  
}

alternative vs splitting
and also look to regex
a1 = aa.indexOf("load")
a2 = aa.indexOf("model")


on load cars position is 10 29 48
scale is 2
turn y 2.4959
run some magic other set of functions

b = func
func b(x,b,m)
log m
let gg = b * 727634 / gofunc(m)
if gg == (==== is the older truthy)
if gg >= 9
then we should flip cat with force 2
return mm
}



taco car position = 10 20 2 rotation = pi/2 0 0
( nodes have stored "taco car" id )
( position being a prop, = being a statement like otherwise parse next fex numbers by spaces or commas )
( rotation is in euler, since spaces rule, then keep math to no spaces for here )

its driving forward at speed 2
(its references state of current subject)
(driving being a feature yet to be determined, but is an effector to be a heading vector)
(speed is attribute of it)

let m = 4
let m 4
let m -> 4
m = 4
( = is preferred, its one character and says what it is )
( let is preferred cause its math notation and short, its also easy to parse the page for variables )

load building 1 model "dfkjngdkfjg"
on load 


lets sort things events like
"on load"


var aa = "on load";
var bb = aa.split(" ")
var hold = x => {console.log(x)}
if(bb[0]+bb[1] === "onload"){
  hold = (url) => { console.log(`im loading ${url} !`) }
}
