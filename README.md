# superuberminigameengine

A tiny game engine of delight

This ones the team work one!~

Game engine: a sum of its parts.


## Base goals 1
## games/notPac

+ Display
+ Loop
+ Render polygon in color
+ Add movement keys to polygon
+ Wrap position
+ Collide polygon to mouse
+ React to mouse
+ High score!!

Base goal 1 does not have an editor yet.
Though mouse could draw squares and the squares go to database, making for the smallest form of an editor


## Basic API

Need a unload()
Most important, so we can swap levels/games from memory
