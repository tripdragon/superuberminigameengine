A tiny game engine of delight

This ones the team work one!~



## Base goals 1

+ Display
+ Loop
+ Render polygon in color
+ Add movement keys to polygon
+ Wrap position
+ Collide polygon to mouse
+ React to mouse
+ High score!!

Base goal 1 does not have an editor yet.
Though mouse could draw squares and the squares go to database, making for the smallest form of an editor
